# Color Guesser Game

This is a game where you have to guess the RGB color code of a randomly generated color. The game has two difficulty levels - easy and hard.

## How the Application Works

- You have to guess the color by clicking on one of the colored squares.
- You gain points by guessing the correct color and have 3 lives that you lose if you guess incorrectly
- If you guess the wrong color, the square disappears and you have to try again.
